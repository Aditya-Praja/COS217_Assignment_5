Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

We used ChatGPT to help us understand concepts of flattened c code.
We did not use AI to generate any flattened code related to this 
assignment, only to provide examples and explanations of concepts.
In addition, we used AI to help understand how assembly files are
structured (i.e. sections, directives, etc.).

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This assignment was very helpful in understanding how high level
languages are translated to low level assembly code. It was fun
seeing how different optimizations can change the
performance of a program.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

What is your mywc program test plan?

Boundary Tests:
1. mywcempty.txt: 
An empty file to test if the program can handle files with no content.
It tests the boundary case where getchar() returns EOF immediately

2. mywcspaces.txt:
A file with only spaces and tabs to test if the program correctly counts
whitespace characters and does not miscount them as words or lines. 
Ensures spaces are handled correctly.

3. mywcnewline.txt:
This file contains exactly one newline character. It tests that the 
program counts one line, zero words, and one character.
Checks if newlines are treated as both characters and line delimiters.

4. mywcHelloWorld.txt:
A file with "hello world" with no newline at the end. Tests the program
when the last word is proceeded by EOF.

5. mywcHelloWorldEndWithSpace.txt:
A file with "hello world " (with a space at the end). Tests the program
when the last word is followed by a space before EOF, ensuring the 
program doesn't miscount words.

Statement Tests:
1. mywcnewLines.txt: 
Contains 20 lines of text with words separated by spaces and terminated 
by newlines. This file executes: the main loop reading characters 
(lines 19-22, 72-79), character counting (lines 24-28), the isspace 
branch to spaceChar for spaces and newlines (lines 30-32, 34-47), 
word end detection incrementing lWordCount when transitioning from word 
to whitespace (lines 38-46), the elseSpace branch for non-whitespace 
characters (lines 49-58), word start detection setting iInWord to true 
(lines 53-57), newline detection incrementing lLineCount (lines 62-70), 
and the final printf and return (lines 88-96).

2. mywcHelloWorld.txt: 
This file ends with a word not followed by whitespace, which tests the 
post loop word path where EOF is reached while iInWord is 
true. This causes execution of lines 81-87, where the program checks 
iInWord and increments lWordCount before printing.

Stress Tests:
1. mywcwordHundred.txt
A smaller stress test with a single long line containing 100 words. 
This stresses repeated word-start detection.

2. mywcManyCharsManyLines.txt
Created using a block of 80 a characters per line repeated 107 tiems. 
This file stresses the main loop with a large input size and tests
line counting performance and correctness with many short, simple lines

3. mywcLongLine.txt
A file with about 15500 characters in a single line without any newlines.
This stresses the program's ability to handle long lines and tests
character and word counting in the absence of line breaks.
